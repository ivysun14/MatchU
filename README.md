# MatchU

Project Overview:
Our dating app is specifically designed for college students who want to connect with others from the same or different colleges. With our app, users can create a profile, highlight their interests and preferences, and swipe through potential matches from other colleges. Our advanced algorithms ensure that users are matched with others who share similar interests and goals. We've also included features that allow users to easily connect with others in their college network and beyond, expanding their social circle and opening up new opportunities for friendship or romance. Our app is the perfect tool for college students who are looking to broaden their horizons and make meaningful connections with others from different colleges.
