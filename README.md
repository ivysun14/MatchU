# MatchU

## Project Overview:
Our dating app is specifically designed for UC students who want to connect with others from the same or different UC campuses. With our app, users can create a profile, highlight their interests and preferences, and search through potential matches. Our advanced algorithms ensure that users are matched with others who share similar interests and goals. We've also included features such as chatting that allow users to easily connect with others in their college network and beyond, expanding their social circle and opening up new opportunities for friendship or romance. Our app is the perfect tool for UC students who are looking to broaden their horizons and make meaningful connections with others from different colleges.

## Project Motivation:
We understand that college can be an isolating experience, and students may find it challenging to meet new people outside of their immediate social circle. By creating this app, we aim to bridge that gap and provide an avenue for UC students to connect with others who share similar interests and goals, regardless of their campuses. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive, and fun space for students to find meaningful connections and make lasting friendships or even romantic relationships.

## How to Use the App:
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ivysun14/MatchU.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory with the cloned repo ./MatchU/ and start the server with:
```
npm run start:dev
```
3. Open a second terminal window and navigate to ./MatchU/app/. Install dependencies and start the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Things to Note:
1. When you open the app in step 3, keep in mind that your server in step 2 must be up and running.<br>
2. Be patient and wait for a few seconds when the web page has opened, then proceed with logging in or registering :)

### Enjoy MatchU!
